# BashLib
Several bash utilities

The idea behind this repo is to aggregate multiple scripts, created to cover differtn administration tasks but without enought weight to justify a repo by itself.

## Existing Modules
Currently, the following modules exist:
 * create-password, to generate a random password
 * rsaenc, creates a RSA encypted package
 * to-phonetic-alphabet, cobverts an ASCII string, composed by printable, non-blank characters into its phonetic representation
 
 All scripts recognize the --help and --version options.
